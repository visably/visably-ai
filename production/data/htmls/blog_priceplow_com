Seventh Gear was formulated to give you extreme energy, focus, and enhance muscular endurance. It has a high dose of stimulants that really pack a punch, and several patented ingredients to get the most out of your training session. And if you&rsquo;re looking more for something to give you an extreme pump, then we suggest stacking Seventh Gear with Hydraulic. That will be one epic stack to get the best of both worlds! Now let&rsquo;s get into what makes Seventh Gear a real heavy hitter! As forewarning, an entire scoop has 387.5mg caffeine! One scoop (9.8g) of Seventh Gear delivers: Beta Alanine &ndash; 3.2g. Seventh Gear is loaded with several patented ingredients to give you extreme focus, energy, and muscular endurance. In order to give you enhanced muscular endurance, then look no further than a clinical dosage of beta alanine to do it for you! This is also an ingredient that you can really feel working, since one of its side effects is a tingling and itchy sensation. Some people love while others could go without, but don&rsquo;t worry it only lasts a few minutes! Beta-alanine has been shown to boost performance in both aerobic and anaerobic activities via increasing the body&rsquo;s endogenous carnosine levels.[1,2] Carnosine is responsible for acting at a lactic acid buffer, which allows the skeletal muscle to resist fatigue for longer.[1,2] Lactic acid build-up is one of the main reasons you reach muscular failure, because it creates a backup in the energy producing systems. As a result, you run out of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell&rsquo;s energy currency, and the muscles no longer have sufficient fuel to keep going. And when you&rsquo;re trying to reach that seventh gear, the last thing you want to do is burn out. Beta alanine is a very common pre workout addition because it&rsquo;s effective, backed by research, and just simply works. If you want to see the best results, it&rsquo;s recommended to take beta alanine daily in order to reach a saturation point. Note: If you&rsquo;re looking at attacking ammonia along with that lactic acid, check out Axe &amp; Sledge&rsquo;s THE GRIND, an intra workout supplement that contains L-ornithine to stomp it out as well! Betaine Anhydrous &ndash; 2g. Next, we have betaine anhydrous, also known as trimethylglycine, to increase your work capacity and power output![3-6] Betaine is an organic osmolyte naturally found in several foods, such as beets and spinach.[3] It&rsquo;s able to boost your performance through three main actions: Take your training to the next level with Seventh Gear From Axe and Sledge! Betaine donates a methyl group to homocysteine, a non proteinogenic amino acid that&rsquo;s been shown to have a negative effect on muscle protein synthesis.[3-5] Not only does it reduce homocysteine levels, it also results in the formation of methionine, a precursor to creatine production.[7] Since betaine is a naturally occuring osmolyte, it can help regulate water and electrolyte balance within the cells.[4,5] As a result the cells are more resistant to stress and it preserves their structure. Last but certainly not least, betaine can boost nitric oxide levels within the body,[6] which definitely helps increase work capacity by giving the muscles more nutrients through enhanced blood flow. Betaine is a very powerful ingredient and works to improve several aspects of performance in various ways! Magnesium Creatine Chelate (Creatine MagnaPower&reg;) &ndash; 1.5g. Creatine is safe, effective, and proven to improve muscular strength, power output, training performance, and delay the onset of fatigue.[8-10] Although the benefits of creatine are very well known, most people are not aware that magnesium is also a powerhouse for endurance and overall performance. On top of that the combination of magnesium and creatine may have a potent synergistic effect, meaning they work better together than on their own. Albion&rsquo;s Creatine Magna Power adds a bit of magnesium to your day, which is something most of us don&rsquo;t get enough of anyway! When the masterminds at Albion Human Nutrition discovered this relationship, they immediately got to work and came up with Creatine MagnaPower &reg;, which consists of magnesium chelated to creatine. Magnesium is a beneficial mineral that helps support several key functions in the body, such as blood pressure regulation, protein synthesis, blood glucose control, and muscle and nerve firing.[11] In addition, some studies have found that when there&rsquo;s an insufficient intake of various minerals, creatine uptake is significantly decreased.[12] Meaning, your body will just end of excreting it, rather than being able to use it. This reduction occurs because electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and magnesium) act as transporters to help the body absorb and utilize the creatine.[12] Therefore, it only makes sense to combine the creatine with magnesium since it will result in better effects! Furthermore, magnesium on its own seems to enhance performance, and studies show that the more active you are, there&rsquo;s a greater risk for developing a magnesium deficiency.[13] Needless to say, we&rsquo;re thrilled that Axe &amp; Sledge decided to use a more well-rounded form of creatine than just the standard creatine monohydrate! Caffeine Anhydrous &ndash; 350mg (out of 387.5mg Total) Now it&rsquo;s time to kick things into the next gear with a high dose of caffeine anhydrous! And this isn&rsquo;t the only form of caffeine that Seventh Gear has to offer, so get ready for some intense energy! Axe and Sledge HWMF Stack, the sweet taste of hard work. If there&rsquo;s one ingredient that has more studies than creatine, it has to be caffeine. The research concludes that caffeine is one of the most powerful ergogenic aids. Caffeine is so effective because it&rsquo;s quickly absorbed in the digestive tract, and dispersed throughout various cell membranes.[14] Furthermore, caffeine is lipid soluble, allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, it&rsquo;s able to affect both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system.[14] Multiple studies show that caffeine, dosed anywhere from 3-6mg/kg, is able to increase energy, strength, power output, mental focus, and endurance.[14] Although researchers propose that caffeine has several mechanisms of action, the main accepted one is that caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist by blocking its receptor site.[14] Adenosine can significantly slow down neural activity, thus being able to combat that is ideal, especially for a difficult training session! Choline Bitartrate &ndash; 250mg. In order to increase your mental focus and mind-muscle connection, Seventh Gear includes 250mg of Choline Bitartrate! Pair Seventh Gear with The Grind to have an epic training session. Choline is an essential nutrient that takes on several roles in the...",

Last month we covered the BEAM Pre Workout, and not only did the flavors blow us away, the way it performed was somehow even better. A pre workout can say a lot about a brand, and it showed that BEAM is all about creating premium supplements to help your workouts be amazing. That was just a glimpse of what their team is capable of, now it&rsquo;s time to see how this newcomer tackles a challenging category, vegan protein powders. Rumor has it that this one tastes dynamite. BEAM Vegan Protein: More Than a Plant-Based Protein Powder. BEAM Vegan Protein quickly became a fan favorite! While every single product BEAM offers is unique in some way, the one that stands out most in our opinions is their 100% Premium Vegan Protein Powder. They use extremely high quality plant-based protein sources, and somehow managed to make it taste phenomenal. We&rsquo;ve heard big claims, such as &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the best tasting vegan protein out there&rdquo;, which is a pretty bold statement since there are some fierce competitors on the market nowadays. We&rsquo;ve already been extremely impressed with several other supplements that BEAM sent us over to try out, but this one definitely blew us away. You&rsquo;re probably wondering what makes BEAM Vegan Protein so unique?

First let&rsquo;s see how BEAM Vegan Protein stacks up on a calorie and macronutrient basis. And after seeing their numbers, yet again, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to believe this is a plant protein. Typically vegan protein powders can really rack up the carbs, but not with BEAM &mdash; and that&rsquo;s very impressive. Getting enough carbs and fats is the easy part, but protein is a whole different story...which is why a lot of people turn to using protein powders to help hit their daily intake. BEAM Vegan Protein is the perfect way to get some extra protein in without the added carbs, fats, sugars, or dairy in this case. BEAM Vegan Protein has one of the best macronutrient profiles we&rsquo;ve seen yet. Here&rsquo;s what one serving (29.5g) of BEAM Vegan Protein provides: Calories: 100. Protein: 20g. Carbs: 3g. Sugars: 0g. Fiber: 1g. Fat: 0.5g. BEAM Vegan Protein has one of the best macronutrient profiles we&rsquo;ve seen in a vegan protein powder. It&rsquo;s incredibly clean, and packs 20g of protein per serving, which will be a great way to fill in any gap left by your diet. Also the taste makes those macronutrients truly unbelievable &mdash; there&rsquo;s not even 1g of sugar. So let&rsquo;s find out what ingredients BEAM uses to pull off this incredible feat! But wait...before we dive into the ingredients, you first need to know a few key things about plant-based protein powders to understand what makes them different from dairy-based products. In this next section, we&rsquo;re going to outline some common issues that arise during the formulation of a vegan protein that must be addressed to create a well-rounded product consumers will actually enjoy. The Issues With Plant-Based Protein Powders. The main things we need to address are: protein quality, taste, texture, and mixability. In order to determine if any protein powder is good, it&rsquo;s a good idea to assess it based on several criteria. We will even highlight specific things to look for in a plant protein, that can help you determine if it&rsquo;s worth your hard earned money! Complete vs Incomplete Protein Sources. First of all, let&rsquo;s talk about protein quality and explain the difference between a complete and incomplete protein source. A complete protein source is typically produced from animal based products, such as fish, dairy, meat, and eggs. It must contain all nine essential amino acids, in appropriate proportions. Great macros and even better flavor! Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are divided up into two main categories, nonessential and essential. Non-essential amino acids don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be consumed because the body can make them from other compounds endogenously. On the other hand, the body cannot produce any of the nine essential amino acids, therefore you have to obtain them from your diet. A prime example of a complete protein that dominates the supplement industry is whey protein. An incomplete protein source means that it lacks one or more of the nine essential amino acids. This normally includes several plant-based protein sources, such as rice or beans. There are some plant proteins that are complete, but it&rsquo;s a very short list. The solution to incomplete protein sources is that you can fix this issue by combining them together to create a complete protein, a very crucial step that often gets missed when adapting a vegan or vegetarian diet. This is especially true if you want to build muscle &mdash; you must be conscious of the protein quality you choose in order to get the appropriate amount of essential amino acids. So if you see a vegan or plant-based protein powder and it only has one source listed, be very cautious because it may not be as helpful as you hope in reaching your health and fitness goals. Taste, Texture, and Mixability, Oh My... A flavor that really lives up to its name! So maybe you find a plant protein that looks great ingredient wise, how&rsquo;s the taste and texture? Beyond protein quality, which is always number one in our minds, having a great flavor and consistency is typically what reels people in. And we definitely don&rsquo;t blame you! With all the great options that exist, why settle for something that&rsquo;s bland and has the consistency of sand paper? You definitely deserve a better product than that, and with BEAM Vegan Protein, that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re going to get. They don&rsquo;t call their products premium for nothing. Sure their labels are eye-catching and the ingredients are high quality, but the flavor, mixability, and smooth consistency really bring this protein over the top. And that&rsquo;s what we expect from a brand that has a team with years of experience. BEAM Ingredients. Now that you understand what to look for in a protein powder, and more specifically a plant-based one, let&rsquo;s see how BEAM does things a little differently with their vegan protein. Since this is a protein powder, we&rsquo;re mainly going to be talking about the protein sources they utilized. However, there are a few extras BEAM adds in, you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else. Lastly, we will touch on how they pull off the amazing flavor and texture that makes it taste more like a dessert than a protein rich drink. Protein Sources &ndash; Pea, Mung Bean, and Pumpkin Seed. BEAM tackles the &ldquo;complete protein&rdquo; issue head-on by including three different plant proteins, Pea Protein, Mung Bean Protein (as Smooth Protein&trade;), and Pumpkin Seed Protein (as Smooth Protein&trade;). Pea Protein. BEAM Vegan Protein Powder Blueberry Muffin ingredient list! They don&rsquo;t list the exact dosages for each protein source, but based on what we know about reading ingredient labels, you can tell pea protein yields the highest amount of protein, followed by mung bean second, and pumpkin seed third (they could also have equivalent amounts). This is great to see, because pea protein is one of the very few plant protein sources that&rsquo;s actually considered complete,[1] meaning it contains sufficient amounts of all nine essential amino acids. Furthermore, studies show that pea protein is just as effective as whey protein for increasing muscle mass.[2] Mung Bean Protein (as Smooth Protein&trade;) Pea protein is a very common ingredient in plant-based protein powders, but what you don&rsquo;t see everyday is mung bean protein. This is more of an unique ingredient, but it packs a host of health benefits! Unreal taste and consistency is achieved with the help of Smooth Protein from Compound Solutions. Studies show that mung beans are a good source of protein, and they&rsquo;re specifically rich in leucine.[3] Leucine is the main branched chain amino acid responsible for initiating muscle protein synthesis. Even though mung beans are a little bit low in two amino acids, methionine and cysteine,[3] when combined with the other protein sources in BEAM Vegan Protein, that will not be an issue at all. Furthermore, mung beans contain various bioactive peptides that may express antiviral and antibacterial effects, along with serving as an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).[3] So you&rsquo;re not only getting a great protein source, it has some health benefits as well! Pumpkin Seed Protein (as Smooth Protein&trade;) Premium flavors with a premium formula, BEAM Vegan Protein does not disappoint! The last protein source included in BEAM Vegan Protein is pumpkin seed protein, another semi-common addition to plant-based protein powders. Pumpkin seeds are known for containing a fairly high amount of protein, in addition to packing a solid antioxidant profile.[4,5] It&rsquo;s not considered to be a complete protein, since studies show it&rsquo;s lacking in the essential amino...",

No matter what your health and fitness goals may be, whether it&rsquo;s stepping on stage, crushing a powerlifting meet, running a marathon, or just trying to lose a few pounds, staying healthy should always be the number one priority. If there&rsquo;s two things that can quickly stall progress (or even set you back), it&rsquo;s getting injured or sick. The stress that hard workouts in harsh environments place on your body can hamper your ability to fight off bacteria and foreign pathogens. Low to moderate intensity exercise is great for not only being healthy, but it&rsquo;s also an easy way to give your immune system a nice boost. However, there are times when getting sick is almost inevitable no matter what you do (parents of children during cold season know this well!). Implementing a diet rich in micronutrient dense food (but not too rich in calories), exercising regularly, sleeping 7-8 hours per night, practicing proper hygiene, and limiting stress are some of the best ways to prevent getting sick. In addition to all of those things, optimal supplementation can serve as your &ldquo;insurance policy&rdquo; to make sure you have the best chance to fight off any forgeign bacteria or pathogen that may come your way! Support Your Immune System with NutraBio EpiCor! Most of us know about Vitamin C, zinc, and maybe even echinacea... but what else is out there? Introducing EpiCor&reg; from NutraBio: A Whole Food Fermentate Geared Towards Boosting Immunity. Although they&rsquo;re best known for creating unrivaled supplements geared towards boosting athletic performance, NutraBio also has a robust line of single-ingredient vitamins and supplements that keep your health in check (see our recent posts on NutraBio Maca and NutraBio Milk Thistle). While they&rsquo;re going bonkers keeping their Vitamin C in stock, they also have a new ingredient geared towards optimizing your immune function, and it goes by the name of EpiCor&reg;. This is the most potent form of dried yeast fermentate we&rsquo;ve seen on the market. In this post, we&rsquo;re going to explain how powerful EpiCor&reg; is, and why you should consider adding it to your daily supplement stack!

NutraBio EpiCor has just one ingredient &mdash; EpiCor &mdash; so you can add it to your own immune/multivitamin stack! There&rsquo;s only one ingredient in this supplement, so we&rsquo;re going to give you a complete overview of what EpiCor&reg; is, how it works, and its benefits as outlined in the research! As you can see from the supplement facts panel, each capsule contains 500mg of Dried Yeast Fermentate from saccharomyces cerevisiae, trademarked as EpiCor&reg; by Embria Health Sciences. One bottle contains 60 capsules and you only need to take one capsule per day to reap all the benefits. Therefore, you&rsquo;re receiving a two month supply for a great price! Now let&rsquo;s get into what EpiCor&reg; can deliver! What is EpiCor&reg;? Embria Health Sciences, the creators of EpiCor&reg;, describes it as &ldquo;a natural dietary supplement ingredient that&rsquo;s been shown to help strengthen the immune system by balancing immune response&rdquo;.[1] They also state, &ldquo;it acts as a multivitamin for your immune system&rdquo;.[1] As we mentioned before, having a good nutrition / metabolic function, exercise, sleep, and hygiene routine are always going to be the most important. EpiCor&reg; is just another way to give you an extra edge. In general, EpiCor&reg; is a whole food yeast fermentate made from saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a natural ingredient composed of beneficial amino acids, polyphenols, vitamins, fibers, beta-glucans, and various other metabolites that can help support your immune system.[2] Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a specific type of yeast that&rsquo;s typically used for making bread and wine. The difference is the processing and production What&rsquo;s most important about EpiCor&reg; specifically, is the way it&rsquo;s processed and produced. Through using a specific fermentation method, Embria is able to maintain all of the nutrients and metabolites that yield the greatest health benefits.[2] Therefore, many classify EpiCor&reg; as a &ldquo;whole food supplement&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s made with natural ingredients and is minimally processed.[2] Furthermore, it&rsquo;s not an extract, byproduct, nor is it chemically synthesized.[2] And, as mentioned below, it&rsquo;s Made in America! But let&rsquo;s get to the most important part &ndash; how the immune system (and EpiCor) works! The Immune System: An Overview. EpiCor is a whole food dried yeast fermentate derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae. On a large scale, EpiCor&reg; was formulated to help strengthen your immune system, but it accomplishes this in several ways. The immune system can be divided into two main divisions, the innate and adaptive immune systems.[3,4] The Innate Immune System: Front line barriers. The innate immune system acts as our first line of defense, which means if the microorganism is able to break past the barriers provided by the innate immune system,[3] then the adaptive immune system will kick in to help. The main goal is of course to avoid letting that happen, though. The innate immune system has several physical and anatomical barriers to keep unwanted pathogens out. This primarily includes the skin and mucosal membranes, which are key components to fighting against foreign invaders.[3] The innate immune system also has various &ldquo;effector&rdquo; cells that help take care of foregin invaders when the barriers fail. They are able to identify pathogens, bacteria, and viruses and take the appropriate steps to help destroy them before they start damaging or infecting healthy cells. This includes: granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, lymphoid cells, and endothelial cells.[3] The Adaptive Immune System. If the first line of defense is not strong enough, the pathogen will make it into the body and start wreaking havoc on your internal systems. That&rsquo;s where the adaptive immune system steps in. This is where your body recruits T-Cells and B-Cells to start creating antibodies and killing off the bacteria.[4] As a result, if you encounter the same pathogen again, the antibodies can recognize it and take care of it straight away.[4] That&rsquo;s how you ultimately build immunity to various viruses and bacteria. It&rsquo;s obviously a lot more complex than that, but we wanted to give you a bit of background information, to help you understand how EpiCor&reg; works. If you would like to learn more, check out this website: What is EpiCor: FAQs. Because as you&rsquo;ll see, EpiCor&reg; helps improve the function of multiple components that make up the immune system! EpiCor&reg;&rsquo;s Four Main Effects. Here are the four mechanisms in which EpiCor&reg; strengthens your immune system: Enhances the secretion of secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) Research shows, EpiCor can significantly enhance SIgA secretion. [5,6] EpiCor&reg; is able to enhance the secretion of secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA), which plays a significant role in our innate immune system.[7,8] SIgA is the primary immunoglobulin present in our mucosal membranes within the respiratory tract and stomach.[5] SIgA constantly monitors the environment to distinguish between good bacteria and foreign invaders.[5] Once it recognizes a pathogen, it can trap it with the sticky mucous membrane, preventing it from entering the body. This is one of the reasons why your body starts building up a lot of mucus when you get sick. It&rsquo;s a defense mechanism to remove existing pathogens and prevent any further bacteria from entering while you recover. It&rsquo;s not like EpiCor&reg; will make you excessively accumulate mucus, but it will ensure that you have enough in case something comes into your respiratory system or gut that&rsquo;s not supposed to! Promotes Greater Natural Killer (NK) Cell Activity. The second way EpiCor helps strengthen your immune system is by promoting greater natural killer (NK) cell activity.[7,9] NK cells are known for their ability to identify cells that have been infected by the pathogen and induce apoptosis (cell death) to get rid of them.[3] Studies show EpiCor can boost NK cell activity![6,9] NK cells are able to accomplish this because of their unique capability to recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens that get produced by the infected cell.[3] This serves as a signal to allow the NK to come &lsquo;take care of business&rsquo; by secreting granules with perforins and granzymes that essentially break down the host cell.[3] NK cells are also able to recognize healthy cells, so they don&rsquo;t start killing everything in sight. If the NK cells are more active, then there&rsquo;s less likelihood of the virus or bacteria spreading further and impacting any additional healthy cells. As mentioned above, NK cells are a part of your innate immune system, whose goal is to take care of invaders before the adaptive immune system has to step in.[3] Boosts Antioxidant Effects. One major thing we didn&rsquo;t mention while explaining the components of the immune system is how antioxidants tie into everything.They help combat harmful molecules called free radicals, which get produced within the body from several different ways, including metabolism, exercise, UV light exposure, pollutants, and cigarette smoke. EpiCor can boost the effectiveness of antioxidants in as little as 2 hours after ingestion.[6,10] A free radical is a...",

            "articleBody": "Year after year, NutraBio CEO Mark Glazier and his team have produced some of the industry&rsquo;s most powerful products, incredible flavors, and brilliant formulas over the past few years. They&rsquo;ve established themselves as an absolute powerhouse, cultivating a reputation that they&rsquo;ve validated in the early aughts of 2020. NutraBio is the industry leader in quality and transparency, and has been for quite some time. One of NutraBio&rsquo;s characteristics that we admire most is its ability to be flexible. They don&rsquo;t just put all of their resources into a single product category. As a company that manufacturers their own supplements, they&rsquo;ve built a team that can effectively formulate products that span virtually all supplemental needs. Glazier has done this through two product &ldquo;families&rdquo; &ndash; the NutraBio &ldquo;Sports Series&rdquo;, and their &ldquo;single-ingredient&rdquo; line. The former consists of products built with formulas that fill athletic needs, such as the newly-released New York Punch flavor of Intra Blast (an enhanced &ldquo;sports drink&rdquo; supplement), while the latter consists of products constructed to fill in dietary and supplemental gaps that you can stack together on your own! Very recently, we covered the launch of NutraBio Maca, which solved a long-standing issue regarding poor-quality maca extracts on the market. Today&rsquo;s story is very similar, only with respect to milk thistle! Higher-Potency Milk Thistle &ndash; the newest member of the NutraBio. NutraBio&rsquo;s Milk Thistle is the latest product to join the all-natural, science-backed health products that we&rsquo;ve come to appreciate. Milk Thistle is most known for its incredible ability to maintain healthy liver function, ensuring that this important vital organ is running smoothly. However, just like with maca, not all milk thistle extracts are equal. NutraBio Milk Thistle uses a European dry extract, *not* a nasty acetone solvent extract. This makes all the difference in the world! If you&rsquo;re searching for ways to keep the body healthy, making liver health a priority can do wonders for your overall well-being. But this isn&rsquo;t just a milk thistle product. In true NutraBio fashion, this is perhaps the milk thistle product, as it uses the most intelligently extracted milk thistle we&rsquo;ve read about. The long story short. This post turned into a monster, so here&rsquo;s what you need to know: Milk thistle has long been used for liver detoxification, especially in terms of damage from drugs (both prescription and illicit), alcohol, environmental toxins, and poor diet Milk thistle&rsquo;s primary constituent is silymarin, which is actually a group of &ldquo;flavonolignans&rdquo;, chiefly silibinin but there are several others. Most other milk thistle supplements are solvent-extracted with acetone, which leaves harmful residue and destroys many of the constituent parts mentioned above NutraBio&rsquo;s European Milk Thistle is instead dry-extracted, which is more costly, but leaves far more potent and bioactive flavonoids and other parts (it is &ldquo;full spectrum&rdquo; but still primarily silymarin). The best studies for improving all kinds of liver damage come at 420mg silymarin per day, spread in three separate doses. NutraBio&rsquo;s Milk Thistle, taken as directed, meets or exceeds these studies. Long story short? This ingredient is insanely effective as an adjunct therapy, and this extract is the real deal, tried-and-true form that comes with NutraBio&rsquo;s third-party lab testing. In this post, we&rsquo;re going to tell you everything we can find about the new NutraBio Milk Thistle, with a special emphasis on the science behind the ingredient and the qualities that make NutraBio&rsquo;s version superior to the competition!

Posts are sponsored in part by the retailers and/or brands listed on this page. This post will be a bit &ldquo;out of order&rdquo; &ndash; first, we&rsquo;ll talk about what&rsquo;s different with NutraBio&rsquo;s extract, assuming you know why you&rsquo;d want to use milk thistle (long story short: liver support and antioxidant action). Then we&rsquo;ll get into milk thistle&rsquo;s research itself. Why is NutraBio&rsquo;s Milk Thistle different? NutraBio Milk Thistle Ingredients: With 3 caps per day, you get well over the amount of silymarin needed to achieve 420mg/day. The NutraBio difference? Milk thistle from Europe! The reason this is important is because European extracts are held to a higher extraction standard due to the governing bodies and laws in some European countries with regards to milk thistle. No acetone extraction for a full spectrum! Typically, milk thistle is acetone-extracted, which will get one active ingredient group in silymarin (which you&rsquo;ll see on other supplement labels), but acetone &mdash; the same solvent used in nail polish remover &mdash; will destroy the rest of the spectrum, and leave a harmful and volatile residue. Instead, European extracts are carefully dry-processed, which is more costly and time-consuming, but keeps the full spectrum of constituents &ndash; closer or identical to many of the clinical studies cited below. Milk thistle is more than just silymarin! The red circle says it all: acetone free! But just because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;full spectrum&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s weak: NutraBio&rsquo;s Milk Thistle still has a high amount of silymarin, the primary active ingredient. And since NutraBio publishes 3rd-party lab testing on all supplements (on top of their own high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] testing), you know purity is ensured. Exceeding the 420mg per day research. Below, you&rsquo;ll see many research studies citing 140mg per day through 420mg per day for the more aggressive treatments. With NutraBio&rsquo;s standardization, you&rsquo;re getting that much in active ingredients (at one or three capsules per day, depending on what study you compare it to), but also get the added benefits of the other constituents kept from the dry, acetone-free extract. This brings a &ldquo;best of all worlds&rdquo;, where you have a product that goes above and beyond what several studies demonstrate. What is Milk Thistle? Silybum marianum, otherwise known as the milk thistle plant, has been used for medicinal purposes in both Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine,[1] with its usage having spanned across Europe and Eastern Europe for centuries. This prickly purple plant gets its name from its appearance &ndash; silybum refers to it being an edible thistle, while marianum references the thin white stripes that lie on the surface of its leaves.[2] Silymarin = silibinin, silydianin, silychristin, and much more. Silybum Marianum, better known as Milk Thistle, has a tremendous amount of research for liver detoxification. Image courtesy Wikimedia Commons. The extract of the milk thistle plant is quite useful, and this is one of those times when ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine got it 100% right. The extract derives its powers from main three flavonolignans (silibinin, silydianin, and silychristin) which, together, form a compound known as silymarin.[2] In addition, there are also flavonolignans like isosilybin, isosilichristin, dehydrosilibin, and dehydrosilichristin. Many think of silymarin as a single compound, but as you can see it&rsquo;s actually a group of these compounds, so keep that in mind. Once again, many of those other compounds can be destroyed by acetone extracts, which is why NutraBio&rsquo;s dry extract is so important. Silibinin doing the heaviest lifting? Silymarin, as we&rsquo;ll soon see, is quite strong, with various medicinal properties &ndash; and many of them are usually credited to silibinin &ndash; of the three bioactives that form silymarin, silibinin is typically around 50% to 70% of the total makeup![2] A typical milk thistle extract is around 60% to 80% silymarin, with the remainder coming from fatty acids natural to the plant.[5] Even more compounds in milk thistle. Aside from the flavonolignans in silymarin listed above, milk thistle also contains the following: Flavonoids: apigenin, eriodictyol, quercetin, chrysoeriol, 5,7-dihydroxychromone, naringenin, dihydrokaempferol, isofraxidin, and taxifolin.[3,4] Neolignan: dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol. Oils: linoleum acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid. There are also fatty acids combined with tocopherol and sterols such as campesterol, cholesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol inside.[3,4] Despite this biological knowledge not being available until modern science became available, the anecdotal use of milk thistle falls in line with what science backs up. Historically, milk thistle has been used to promote liver health in virtually any way possible. Dubbed a &ldquo;liver tonic&rdquo;, this substance is utilized to ward off various chemicals and toxins that can be damaging to the liver.[2] Having displayed its prowess in practice, it was only a matter of time before scientists dug into the ingredient in the hopes of validating such benefits! How does Milk Thistle work? While research is still investigating the exact mechanisms that make this protective interaction possible, there have been some possible reasons found in studies utilizing mice. In 1986, scientists found that the injection of silibinin in mice that were missing a piece of their liver spurned protein synthesis in their livers.[6] This and other hepatoprotective properties that have been seen in mice studies have led scientists to hypothesize that milk thistle stimulates RNA and polymerase I activation,[2,7] though most studies state that further research is needed to confirm or deny this educated guess. Silymarin is not just one compound &ndash; it&rsquo;s a group of compounds! That being said...",

Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s iconic pre workout gets an update. And now it&rsquo;s better than ever! Fitness buffs and gym junkies alike know the name Kris Gethin. When he debuted his supplement line, Kaged Muscle, it was met with rave reviews. Initially the brand was just releasing high quality bulk supplements that you could add to your existing selection of pre, intra, and post workouts. It was doing incredibly well, but after several requests, Kaged Muscle knew it was time to formulate a complete pre workout that would blow away any other formula on the market. After months of research, testing, and revisions, they finally released Pre-Kaged, which became an instant best seller! This pre workout shocked the industry, by featuring a nearly 30g serving size filled with ingredients that would cover all of your workout needs from focus to power to pumps to energy. Pre-Kaged Gets An Update Based On Your Feedback! Customers love Pre-Kaged so they didn&rsquo;t want to change it too much! But that was back in 2015, so what&rsquo;s changed since then? Over the years, Pre-Kaged has really built a strong reputation in the industry, by winning several awards from big companies such as Vitamin Shoppe and Bodybuilding.com, while also receiving thousands of 5 star reviews. At first, Pre-Kaged was only available in Fruit Punch, but now you can find it in Pink Lemonade, Orange Krush, Berry Blast, and Krisp Apple! And if that&rsquo;s not all, Kaged Muscle releaseed Stim-Free Pre-Kaged that can be stacked with Pre-Kaged, allowing you to customize your caffeine intake, but still get all the active ingredients! It&rsquo;s safe to say that Pre-Kaged was formulated very well from day one, because they never had to make any big changes to keep up with the competition. It&rsquo;s not like Kaged Muscle is against updating their formulas, but if something isn&rsquo;t broke, why fix it? And the reviews and awards speak for themselves. However, Kaged Muscle is all about giving their customers the best product possible. And over the past five years since Pre-Kaged launched, they&rsquo;ve collected you feedback and decided 2020 was the perfect year to make a few minor tweaks to the massive formula we all know and love. Over the past few years, we have been asked by our customers if we could work on improving the mixability of PRE-KAGED&reg;. Since PRE-KAGED&reg; contains a lot of natural ingredients and a massive 30g serving size this was no easy task. Our team optimized PRE-KAGED&reg; by making 2 ingredient changes. First, we removed 200mg of quercetin. This substantially improved the mixability and flavor profile. Second BetaPower was increased from 2g to 2.5 grams, giving you 25% more per serving. You can now mix PRE-KAGED&reg; with less water if you prefer and will experience a smoother flavor with improved mixability. -Kaged Muscle But for all you die hard Pre-Kaged fans, don&rsquo;t worry, because the formula hasn&rsquo;t changed too much!

Posts are sponsored in part by the retailers and/or brands listed on this page. Note: In 2020, many stores will still have the original Pre-Kaged formula. For the new formula, look for 2.5g betaine anhydrous on the label, ask the retailer, or get the one directly from Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s website! Pre-Kaged Ingredients. Pre-Kaged is serious about providing you with any and all raw materials your body will need to dominate whatever your workout maybe. Weighing in with a hefty 29.4g per single scoop, KG left no stone unturned in what you would need to be primed and ready to tackle your weight training session. For the new formula, Kaged Muscle simply removed the quercetin and bumped up the betaine anhydrous dose to 2.5g! These small tweaks allow you to use less water with Pre-Kaged, while giving it improved mixability. Now, let&rsquo;s get right to what this award-winning beast has to offer! Pro-Pump&trade; L-Citrulline &ndash; 6.5g. Based on your feedback, Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s iconic pre workout, Pre-Kaged, has a very updates to the formula! Take a look at the dosage one more time. That&rsquo;s not 6.5g of citrulline malate, that&rsquo;s 6.5g of pure L-Citrulline! This is a HUGE dose! Normally, we like to see 6-8g of the citrulline malate, as this supplies anywhere from 3-4g of citrulline. Here, you get double that amount, which is one of the biggest amounts we&rsquo;ve ever seen in a pre workout. This should lead to some rather intense pumps during your workout and will probably have your veins popping through your skin. Just be wary though, as high doses of Citrulline have been known to cause GI upset in some users. Either way, endurance and nitric oxide levels will get a healthy boost from this potent workout ergogenic aid.[1,2] Muscle Fuel Matrix &ndash; 3.5g. Pre-Kaged uses the research-backed ratio of 2:1:1, which means in each serving, you get 1,750mg of leucine, 875mg of isoleucine, and 875mg of valine. BCAAs provide a host of benefits to those engaged in tough training, namely: Stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis[3] Offset Fatigue[4] Improve Fat Loss[3] Prevent catabolism[5] Anabolic-Activator &ndash; 3g more leucine. Stim-Free Pre-Kaged is finally here and it features all the same ingredients as the OG Pre-Kaged, but without the caffeine! As if 3.5g of total BCAAs wasn&rsquo;t enough to stoke your anabolic fire, Pre-Kaged includes 3g of L-Leucine to further stimulate muscle protein synthesis. L-Leucine is the &ldquo;golden boy of the BCAAs&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s the anabolic activator that kick starts the mTOR (or Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) signaling process which plays a significant role in muscle-building.[6] However, since Pre-Kaged seems to be a supplement for those wanting to build muscle and bulk up, protein intake should already be high, which might not necessitate the inclusion of extra leucine. But either way, we&rsquo;re a fan of Leucine and won&rsquo;t bash a product for including some lagniappe. We&rsquo;re just curious if it would have been better to save money and get a full dose of creatine or beta alanine instead? And why in the hell not just put 4.75g of leucine on the label? Seems odd, but hey, we&rsquo;ll take it. Strength &amp; Power Matrix. BetaPower&reg; &ndash; 2.5g. BetaPower&reg; is a trademarked form of the increasingly popular pre workout ingredient, betaine anhydrous. It works synergistically with creatine to support its production in the body as well as overall ATP production.[7] On its own, betaine has demonstrated the capability to improve hydration, power, strength, and endurance.[8-10] This leads to all around better workouts which ultimately translates into more muscle! CarnoSyn&reg; Beta Alanine &ndash; 1.6g. The only patented form of beta-alanine on the market! This is everyone&rsquo;s favorite tingle-inducing amino acid. But, it does so much more than make you feel all warm and fuzzy. Beta alanine increases the carnosine levels in your muscle[10], which will help buffer the accumulation of lactic acid caused by doing the high volume workouts Kris Gethin is well-regarded for. This will help eliminate that &ldquo;burning sensation you feel while at the same time increasing your strength, power, and endurance.[11-13] Research shows that to get the maximum benefit from BA supplementation, you want to get 3.2g worth, so to get your daily quota, you may want to top this off with some bulk BA. Creatine HCl &ndash; 1.5g. Want even more creatine? Kaged Muscle has you covered with CreaClear! Creatine HCl is perhaps the most popular alternative form of creatine. This is due to its enhanced absorption and bioavailability over monohydrate. Due to this, it&rsquo;s been suggested that you don&rsquo;t need the same amount as monohydrate to see the same benefits. Additionally, many people love this form as it doesn&rsquo;t lead to bloating or GI distress that so many experience when using monohydrate. However, no research exists to substantiate any of these claims, which most would expect to see by now. Now, some preliminary findings suggest that these two ingredients MIGHT overlap, thereby indicating that you don&rsquo;t need the full 2.5g of Betaine and 3-5g of Creatine to maintain saturation. However, there isn&rsquo;t much science available as opposed to getting at least 3g of creatine. So to be on the safe side, you may want to add another 2-4g of creatine to maintain saturation levels. Hydrate &amp; Defend. Coconut Water Powder &ndash; 500mg. What&rsquo;s the origin of pink lemonade? Who knows, but this flavor is terrific! Coconut water is beginning to show up more and more in pre and intra workout supplement. This is due to its high electrolyte content that will helps ensure proper hydration levels.[14] High amounts of electrolytes are lost during intense workout which can can lead to muscle cramping and the muscle failing to fully contract. Ensuring your hydration and electrolyte levels is of the utmost importance if you&rsquo;re looking to really push the envelope every time you step in the weight room. SPECTRA&trade; Total ORAC blend &ndash; 100mg. SPECTRA&trade; is a blend of powdered nutrients aimed to support the body&rsquo;s immune and antioxidant defense systems. Any time we exercise, we break down muscle fibers and trigger the release of free radicals in the body. Antioxidants counter the effects of oxidative stress on the body induced by exercise. Another popular supplement that&rsquo;s had a nice ORAC blend is Marc Lobliner&rsquo;s MTS Drop Factor, which ranks well in our Top 10 Fat Burners list. While this may sound like a good thing, recent research has shown that consuming high potency antioxidants like Vitamins E and C can actually...",

            "articleBody": "When people say they want to lose weight, what they really mean is lose fat. It&rsquo;s a small but important distinction in the pursuit of achieving the physique you&rsquo;re aiming for. If you just lose weight, that could consist of a mixture of muscle, fat, and water. In order to be lean, fit, and muscular, your goal should be to maximize fat loss while minimizing muscle loss. Two advanced formulas to maximize fat loss and retain lean muscle mass! Even though there are countless fat burners on the market, they don&rsquo;t address one of the root causes of weight gain: lack of satiety due to low protein diet. And one of the most underrated supplements that can actually help you achieve a better body composition is protein powder, simply due to what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;protein leverage&rdquo;.[1] Not that there&rsquo;s anything magical about protein powders, but if you struggle to get in enough protein for the day then, they can really make a difference in preventing overeating. Most don&rsquo;t understand that part &mdash; not only does a high protein intake support muscle growth, it also helps suppress appetite and has the highest thermic effect out of all three macronutrients.[2] This means your body burns more calories breaking down protein than carbs or fat, and some actually consider protein to be three calories per gram due to the additional work required. It may only make up a small percentage of your caloric expenditure for the day, but when you&rsquo;re trying everything you can to lose the last bit of fat, an upward shift in protein intake &ndash; especially before eating other foods &ndash; can really make a difference! Although you don&rsquo;t see very many protein powders marketed as &ldquo;weight loss&rdquo; products, they are extremely helpful. And with a few added ingredients, it&rsquo;s a great supplement to aid your journey towards a more healthy body composition. But perhaps there are a few extra things we can add to protein powder to make it closer to nutrient-dense food... Introducing Myprotein&rsquo;s Protein Diet Series. We can&rsquo;t think of a better company than Myprotein to produce a product line that contains a high quality source of protein, along with a few simple, yet effective, ingredients to maximize fat loss. Especially for those who aren&rsquo;t eating diets that are high enough in protein in the first place! Hit your daily protein target with the help of Myprotein&rsquo;s robust line of products! Myprotein knew that there was a large group of people that would benefit from a well-formulated protein powder geared towards fat loss, so they made it happen with, what we&rsquo;re calling, their Protein Diet series. The new subcategory features both Vegan Diet Blend and Impact Diet Whey. The long story short is that these are protein powders that include some L-carnitine, green tea extract, CLA (only in the whey), evodiamine, fiber, probiotics, and digestive enzymes to assist you and your gut in your weight loss journey. Having two options allows you to enjoy the benefits of this methodology regardless of what diet you prefer! But if you&rsquo;re just looking for a protein powder that doesn&rsquo;t have any extra ingredients, then don&rsquo;t worry, because Myprotein still has the biggest selection of protein we&rsquo;ve ever seen. In this post, we&rsquo;re going to discuss the key ingredients, features, and benefits of Myprotein&rsquo;s Vegan Diet Blend and Impact Diet Whey to help you understand what makes them stand out.

Despite having different protein sources, these two products have virtually the same additional ingredients and macronutrients/calories. The first thing we&rsquo;re going to discuss is their macronutrient profiles, since that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most important with dieting. If you&rsquo;re not in a caloric deficit, then don&rsquo;t expect to lose any weight, and if you&rsquo;re not getting enough protein, don&rsquo;t expect great body composition achievements. So let&rsquo;s see how both of these products stack up! Vegan Diet Blend&rsquo;s Macronutrients. 7g of fiber and 20g of protein will keep you full for hours! One serving of Vegan Diet Blend is roughly 32g per scoop and delivers: Calories: 110. Protein: 20g. Carbs: 8g. Fiber: 7g. Sugar: 0g. Fat: 0g. Overall, those are some very solid macronutrients for a plant-based protein powder, especially when your calories are getting quite low. It&rsquo;s a convenient way to ensure you&rsquo;re hitting your daily protein intake, while not taking up too much carbs or fats. Plus, as you&rsquo;ll see, despite being a bit higher in calories, the Vegan Diet Blend has 7g of fiber to help suppress your appetite,[3] while the Impact Diet Whey does not. No matter what, plant-based proteins always have a higher carb content then dairy ones, so at least the majority of the carbs are fiber! With 20g of protein, zero grams of fat and sugar, this is a real winner in our opinion &ndash; if you can handle the dairy! Plus Myprotein knows how to flavor a protein powder, which will help crush your cravings too. Now let&rsquo;s see what the dairy alternative has to offer. Impact Diet Whey&rsquo;s Macronutrients. Impact Diet Whey&rsquo;s macronutrients are lean, clean, and ready to help you achieve your goals! One serving of Impact Diet Whey is around 25.6g and provides: Calories: 90. Protein: 20g. Carbs: 3g. Fiber: 0g. Sugars: 0g. Fat: 0g. The proof is in the labels, Impact Diet Whey is 20 calories less than the Vegan Diet Blend and that&rsquo;s because it has nearly half the carbs. However, in the grand scheme of things, a few carbs really isn&rsquo;t too big of an issue, even for low-carb dieters. If you&rsquo;re just trying to lose a few pounds, or maybe you digest plant proteins better, then by all means go for that. But if you don&rsquo;t have a problem with whey and want to spare every calorie you can then, look no further than Impact Diet Whey! Both are incredibly clean and lean, so it&rsquo;s nice to see Myprotein offering two different options for people to pick from. Over the years, they&rsquo;ve really lived up to their name and we like seeing them push the industry towards creating more innovative protein products. Vegan Diet Blend and Impact Diet Whey Ingredients. Alright, so now you know how these two proteins stack up on a calorie and macronutrient basis, but that&rsquo;s not really what makes them a product geared towards dieting. It&rsquo;s all about the ingredients! Although they have some similarities, there are a few key differences between Vegan Diet Blend and Impact Diet Whey that may sway your decision on which one is best for you. Therefore, we&rsquo;re first going to do a quick overview of each one&rsquo;s ingredients, and then dive into some research on why Myprotein chose to throw in some extras to help burn fat! Vegan Diet Blend Ingredient Overview: Protein Source: Combination of Pea Protein Isolate and Brown Rice Protein. As you can clearly see Vegan Diet Blend has a few different ingredients than Impact Diet whey, but it still delivers great results! Fat Burning Additions: L-Carnitine L-Tartrate &ndash; 150mg. Green Tea extract &ndash; 50mg. Evodiamine. Inulin (fiber) Ganeden BC30&reg; Probiotic (Bacillus Coagulans) DigeZyme&reg; Enzyme Blend: &alpha;-Amyase, Protease, Lipase, Cellulase, and Lactase. Thickening Agents: Xanthan Gum and Guar Gum. Naturally Flavored. Naturally Sweetened: Stevia Leaf Extract. Now, let&rsquo;s see how that list compares to the Impact Diet Whey! Impact Diet Whey Ingredient Overview. Protein Source: Whey Protein Isolate. Impact Diet Whey includes L-Carnitine L-Tartrate, CLA, Green Tea Extract, and Evodiamine to boost your metabolism! Fat Burning Additions: L-Carnitine L-Tartrate &ndash; 150mg. Conjugated Linolenic Acid (CLA) &ndash; 100mg. Green Tea Extract &ndash; 50mg. Evodiamine. Ganeden BC30&reg; Probiotic (Bacillus Coagulans) Digestive Enzymes: Papain and Bromelain. Naturally and Artificially Flavored. No Added Thickening Agents. Artificially Sweetened: Sucralose and Ace-K. Key Differences Between Impact Diet Whey and Vegan Diet Blend. Protein Sources. If you prefer a plant-based diet, Myprotein has you covered with Vegan Diet Blend! The most obvious difference between these two products are the protein sources (pea and brown rice protein vs whey protein isolate), however both are very high quality and do a great job at providing enough essential amino acids to fuel muscle protein synthesis,[4-5] thus helping you keep your gains as you lose the fat. Like we mentioned, protein has a high satiety index, which keeps you fuller for longer.[2] And it has the highest thermic effect out of all the other macronutrients, making your body work harder to break it down, resulting in greater caloric expenditure.[2] Although protein is very important, that&rsquo;s not going to be the main focus here. Fat Burning Extras. As you can see from the list: both products contain L-Carnitine L-Tartrate, Green Tea Extract, and Evodiamine, which are all ingredients that were added to improve fat oxidation. But Impact Diet Whey also has CLA, and that&rsquo;s another ingredient that is a healthy fatty acid that may further help you lose some fat if you&rsquo;re...",

            "articleBody": "Prepare to learn everything you need to know about MCT Oil, or Medium Chain Triglycerides Lifestyle, training, and diet are the three overarching umbrellas that affect our health and fitness goals, and figuring out how to best balance them is unique from person to person. For instance, someone trying to lose body fat trains differently, eats differently, and goes about their day differently than a powerlifter on a strength cycle. But central in almost any fitness plan is nutrition. Although needs shift from person to person, eating nutrient-dense foods full of essential minerals, fats, and amino acids (protein) is at the root of any diet. MCT Oil: The saturated fat for training both your body and your mind! When we say &ldquo;nutrient-dense&rdquo; and &ldquo;essential&rdquo;, there is a great amount of misunderstanding. Our take is that a highly-misunderstood &ldquo;essential&rdquo; fat is saturated fat, and a group of these increasingly popular fats are in the group of medium chain triglycerides, which boast powerful health benefits. Otherwise known as MCT (or MCT Oil), these critically useful fatty acids are finally getting recognition like other important fatty acids. As a high-quality source of dietary fat, MCTs have a ton to offer, with evidence supporting it can yield positive effects in your training, your body, and your mind! TL;DR (Article Summary) MCT Oil, short for medium chain triglycerides, are a group of saturated fatty acids that are quickly-absorbed for rapid energy thanks to their shorter structure. Saturated fat is healthy. There is no causal link whatsoever between saturated fat and heart disease or obesity. In fact, the obesity crisis began when we collectively replaced saturated fat with omega-6 polyunsaturated fats from &ldquo;vegetable oils&rdquo;. (See the saturated fat discussion) The medium chain triglycerides, or &ldquo;MCTs&rdquo;, are a group of saturated fatty acids with &ldquo;medium&rdquo; chain lengths, ranging from six to twelve carbon bonds. These fatty acids caproic acid (C6), Caprylic acid (C8), Capric acid (C10), and Lauric acid (C12). (See the MCT Intro section) When supplemented, MCTs demonstrated the following benefits: Decreased appetite (through increased satiety), increased cognition, improved beta-oxidation (fat burning) rates, better gut health, and potential immune system improvements. (See the MCT oil benefits section) When looking for quality MCT Powder, C8 (Caprylic Acid) is the way to go, and C8Vantage from NNB Nutrition is where to get it. Read more here and on NNBNutrition.com Due to unfavorable characteristics of C6 and C12, C8 and C10 are the preferred MCTs to supplement, with C8 having the best data in terms of beta oxidation and ketone generation. (See the MCT Supplements section) Preferred MCT Oil Products: For powdered MCT Oil, we prefer C8Vantage, which is made by NNB Nutrition and is a nearly-pure C8 formula that is GMO-Free, vegan-friendly, and has no glycemic impact since it is plated on tapioca prebiotic fiber and pea protein, bt other dairy-based options are available as well. For liquid MCT Oil, we prefer Nuton Brainfood, which comes in C8-only and C8+C10 versions. (See the MCT oil products section) In this post, we&rsquo;re going to take a deep dive into MCTs &ndash; what they are, why they&rsquo;re different, how to use them, and where you can find the best ones &ndash; both in liquid and powder form. We&rsquo;re also going to look at published research focused on MCTs, which will help us paint a clearer picture of their benefits. Brace yourself for an in-depth, science-backed look at a food seemingly built for athletic and cognitive performance!

Before we can get into medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and all they have to offer, it&rsquo;s imperative that we begin by discussing dietary fats in general, and what separates the MCTs from the rest. Saturated Fat is back on the menu, folks! And if you still don&rsquo;t want red meat, MCTs are a great source of healthy saturated fats. Read the research and see how saturated fat is not associated with heart disease. Not so long ago, dietary fats were portrayed as a common enemy by Western governments and their sponsors. The distorted theory that &ldquo;dietary fat leads to body fat&rdquo; only paints half of the picture, and we&rsquo;ve begun to understand the importance of quality dietary fat within the sphere of living a healthy lifestyle. In appropriate amounts, fats are imperative for overall health, especially in regards to keeping your heart in check. That being said, not all fats are created equal &ndash; there are multiple &ldquo;groups&rdquo; of fats, some of which are superior to others &ndash; and others that are downright toxic and obesogenic. For instance, it&rsquo;s well-agreed that monounsaturated fats from meat, nuts, and fruits like olives and avocados are quite beneficial,[1] and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish are incredibly healthy.[2] However, not all polyunsaturated fats are the same &mdash; omega-6 polyunsaturated fats from &ldquo;vegetable oils&rdquo; are highly obesogenic and inflammatory.[3] But what about saturated fats? What to make of saturated fats. The &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; of Saturated Fats&rsquo; carbon atoms makes it more stable and less prone to oxidation or rancidity. The less we eat of them, and the more omega-6 polyunsaturated fats like linoleic acid we eat... the sicker we get. The picture seems to be a bit cloudier when discussing another important group of fats, saturated fats. This family of dietary fats are different in a couple of ways, especially in their construction: saturated fats have no double bonds between any carbon atoms, whereas unsaturated fatty acids do. In other words, each carbon atom is completely saturated with hydrogen atoms,[4] yielding a far more stable bond structure, and less likely to go rancid like polyunsaturated fats. Saturated fats are commonly found in animal products, heavy dairy products, and coconut oil, one of the top MCT sources available. But as we&rsquo;ll see below, coconut oil itself isn&rsquo;t the best way to get MCTs in. First, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into the controversy of saturated fat: The research on saturated fat conflicts with modern recommendations from &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; While there seems to be a consensus in the stances on unsaturated fats, there is a high level of dissonance regarding saturated fats. There seems to be an unwarranted stigma towards them, even though science doesn&rsquo;t support the notion that saturated fats are hazardous: Research suggests that saturated fats actually improve cholesterol levels and composition by enlarging the size of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol molecules.[5] This is important, considering that larger LDL molecules may reduce the risk of heart disease![6] A 2015 meta-analysis of 76 studies found no relationship between saturated fat and heart disease.[7] The data is simply not there to connect saturated fat and heart disease risk. Other factors must be at play. But two things are for sure: trans fats are bad news and omega-3&rsquo;s are very good.[7] A 2019 re-analysis of the research used by the &ldquo;American Heart Association&rdquo; suggesting limits on saturated fat intake actually determined that their trials contained methodological flaws and didn&rsquo;t even meet acceptable modern standards for inclusion.[8] The &ldquo;4 Core Trials&rdquo; used by the American Heart Association to push saturated fat elimination are woefully poorly done and out of date.[8] It included a meta analysis of 19 studies (10 of which were randomized controlled trials) showing a lack of association between saturated fatty acid intake and heart disease.[8] Americans did listen to the food guidelines.. and we got sicker and fatter than ever. Are we sure red meat, saturated fat, and cholesterol are really the issue?! If saturated fat is unhealthy, then why did we get sicker when we stopped eating them? As you can see, the bad rap that saturated fats get are quite overstated. There was no obesity epidemic when we were eating plenty of red meat and butter. In fact, the epidemic started when we stopped eating saturated fats, and switched to the toxic omega-6 polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils. The data supports that saturated fat intake is something that&rsquo;s fine in amounts that don&rsquo;t cause you to gain weight. As a dieting adult, you shouldn&rsquo;t eat anything to the point of fat gain, and you certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be completely excluding it either! Now that we&rsquo;ve briefly touched on the different types of fats and the research around them, we can start discussing MCT oil, a type of saturated fat that has significant benefits when consumed responsibly! Medium-chain triglycerides &ndash; faster metabolization, faster availability. Also known as Caproic Acid, Hexanoic Acid (C6) is a potent MCT, but yields a burning sensation in the throat, which is why it&rsquo;s not used in supplements. Earlier, we mentioned the carbon construction of fatty acids, and this becomes pertinent with MCTs. The name &ldquo;medium-chain triglycerides&rdquo; is actually derived directly from that molecular build &ndash; MCTs are fatty acids with somewhere between six to twelve carbon atoms.[9] There are four different MCTs, some combination of the which ultimately comprise MCT oil: Caproic acid (C6) &ndash; six carbon bonds* Also known as octanoic acid, Caprylic Acid (C8) is the most effective MCT for oral supplementation. Caprylic acid (C8) &ndash; eight carbon bonds. Capric acid (C10) &ndash; ten carbon bonds. Lauric acid (C12) &ndash; twelve carbon bonds** *Caproic acid (C6), also known as Hexanoic acid, is normally filtered out because it causes a burning sensation in the throat and great gastrointestinal distress, although it is very ketogenic.[10] Capric Acid (C10) is also...",

            "articleBody": "Ryse helps you reach peak performance by using patented ingredients, transparent labels, and clinical dosages. It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that Ryse Supps burst onto the scene, but in such a short period of time, they really made a name for themselves. But it&rsquo;s not a surprise that they&rsquo;ve grown into being such an influential company, because this brand does everything a bit different. Just look at their packaging, labels, flavors, and most importantly, the formulas. Ryse takes a lot of pride in producing products that will help you rise to greatness. So don&rsquo;t expect to see ineffective ingredients, subclinical dosages, or proprietary blends. Ryse is all about transparency, quality, and results &mdash; it&rsquo;s really that simple. And if you&rsquo;ve tried any of their products, you know exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about, because they are the perfect example of what Ryse values. Introducing Ryse Supps and Project Blackout Ryse Supps Project Blackout Pre and Pump make the perfect duo! Over the years, Ryse Supps has put out some very popular products, such as Loaded Protein, VitaFocus, and the Ryse Supps Pre Workout. Although their supplements all do extremely well, there were enough customers that wanted even more. Ryse noticed there weren&rsquo;t many well-formulated products built towards the more &lsquo;intense&rsquo; lifter. This makes sense, because that&rsquo;s a fairly niche population to cater towards. The majority of brands are trying to go more mainstream to reach a wider audience, leaving a large opportunity to the &ldquo;niche of intensity&rdquo; that Ryse feasts upon. The consumers who would rather hit the barbell than the barstool are the ones who will be your most loyal customer, so long as the brand can deliver the type of products they&rsquo;re looking for. So not only did Ryse want to create more advanced supplements for themselves to use, they wanted to offer them to a group of people who are often left behind. Not to mention, Ryse works with some highly elite athletes, who need everything they can get to out-train and beat the competition. It was time for the next level of Ryse. It was time for Project Blackout. A new advanced, stronger series with a spin on the darker side. Blackout Pre: Formulated For The Elite. Ryse to greatness with Blackout Pre! The first two supplements Ryse released under Project Blackout were Blackout Pre, a high stim advanced pre workout formula, and Blackout Pump, a non-stim pump formula. This allows consumers to have more options, because not every gym session requires you to be stimmed out of your mind, but some days you need an extra kick! The Blackout Pump and Pre can be stacked together or taken separately, it&rsquo;s your choice, but no matter what they will deliver results guaranteed. Project Blackout has been a major hit for Ryse and PricePlow keeps hearing how great the pre workout is, so it&rsquo;s time for us to see what all the hype is about! In this post, we analyze the formula, explain the benefits and differences between their other pre workout, and highlight how to use it in order to get the best results. Project Blackout is a new beginning for Ryse, so subscribe to our Ryse Supps news alerts for more product launches, deals, giveaways, and reviews!

Keep in mind that Ryse wanted to create a more advanced, higher stim product without using anything borderline grey market. So don&rsquo;t expect to see any exotic stimulants or ingredients that will probably be banned in a few years. Ryse is dedicated to giving you the most safe and effective supplements they can produce, therefore you can expect to see several patented or trademarked ingredients, backed by plenty of research. This is a high stim product that contains nearly 410mg of caffeine, so get ready for long lasting energy that will carry you through the most grueling training sessions. Now that we&rsquo;ve warned you, let&rsquo;s see what one serving (12.6g) of Project Blackout Pre has in store! A high stim pre workout with several other ingredients that give you a pump and laser focus! Beta-Alanine (as CarnoSyn&reg;) &ndash; 3.2g. We told you Ryse uses patented ingredients at clinical dosages, and here&rsquo;s a prime example of that, because they start out with 3.2g of CarnoSyn&reg; beta alanine! Several studies show that beta alanine supplementation can significantly increase levels of carnosine within the skeletal muscle.[1-3] This is the main reason you see a performance boost from beta alanine. One of carnosine&rsquo;s main roles is to buffer lactic acid that accumulates during exercise.[1-3] As a result, there&rsquo;s lower levels of acidity, allowing you to work harder for longer. Although beta alanine is most well known for increasing performance in events lasting anywhere from one to four minutes, it can also improve high intensity, more anaerobic types of activity as well![1-3] Whenever you take a pre workout and start feeling a tingling or itching sensation, you can blame it on beta alanine. But the benefits it provides are well worth the feeling, even if you&rsquo;re not a fan of the tingles, known as paresthesia. Most people stop feeling it once they&rsquo;ve built up a tolerance anyway. So beyond the tingling sensation, there&rsquo;s a very good reason why Ryse included beta alanine to kick off the start of Blackout Pre&rsquo;s formula! Choline Bitartrate (as VitaCholine&reg;) &ndash; 1.5g. Next up is an ingredient to help increase your mind muscle connection and mental focus, Choline bitartrate trademarked as VitaCholine&reg;. Choline: An Essential Nutrient. Once you ingest it, the choline molecule will dissociate from the bitartrate and help boost your body&rsquo;s acetylcholine levels![4,5] On a very basic level, acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that helps cells communicate, it&rsquo;s very crucial in telling the muscle to contract.[4,5] Choline plays an important role in the brain, so having greater amounts help with focus, memory, and learning.[4] As you can see, it&rsquo;s a pretty powerful component of both health and performance. And with Ryse Blackout Pre, you&rsquo;re getting what we consider the best form of choline bitartrate, too: VitaCholine Takes The Crown! VitaCholine contains pure L+Choline Bitartrate for maximum absorption and bioavailability! VitaCholine was developed by a leader in ingredient development, Balchem,[4] And what makes it stand out from the rest of the choline bitartrate on the market is that you&rsquo;re getting the pure L-isomer.[4] Let&rsquo;s explain what that means &mdash; there are two forms of choline bitartrate that exist in the supplement world. Both consist of a choline molecule bound to two tartaric acids, however one is the devoratory form, known as D-Choline Bitartrate, and the other is the levorotatory isomer, called L-Choline Bitartrate. If it doesn&rsquo;t specifically say VitaCholine or L+Choline on the label, then you&rsquo;re most likely getting a mixture of the two. And those other forms are less ideal because the levorotatory or &ldquo;left-handed&rdquo; isomer is the only bioactive form &ndash; just what VitaCholine uses. Therefore, you would have to take roughly twice the dosage to get the same results! In summary we are thrilled to see VitaCholine on the label, because you know exactly what you&rsquo;re getting! Huge focus dose alert! And by the way, 1.5g is a monster dose. We&rsquo;ve seen choline dosed that high on rare occasion... but we&rsquo;ve never seen VitaCholine dosed this high. Get ready to feel the focus and the &ldquo;mind-muscle connection&rdquo;. Betaine Anhydrous &ndash; 1.5g. In order to boost your power output, 1.5g of betaine anhydrous is here to make that happen. Grab Blackout Pre to fuel your training sessions and Loaded Protein to help you recover for the next one! Betaine, also commonly referred to as trimethylglycine, acts as both an osmolyte and methyl donor inside the body.[6,7] Due to its ability to take on these two roles, betaine can help maintain proper water balance within the cells, increase levels of nitric oxide (NO), and lower the amount of homocysteine synthesis.[6,7] All of these actions contribute to betaine&rsquo;s ability to improve power output, body composition, strength, and work capacity.[6-9] It may even lead to greater production of creatine because when betaine donates a methyl group to homocysteine, a precursor to creatine is produced known as methionine.[6-9] This is very conducive to performance benefits, since we all know the power of more creatine! You may look at the dosage and think that&rsquo;s a bit low compared to the 2.5g clinical doses, but there&rsquo;s another form of betaine coming next, so no need to worry! Betaine Nitrate (as NO3-T&reg;) &ndash; 1g. Betaine nitrate (NO3-T) is a patented and trademarked nitrate ingredient, which ensures you&rsquo;re getting a quality, pure, and safe compound. As the name suggests, betaine nitrate consists of trimethylglycine combined with nitrate. The Machine is licensing this ingredient from ThermoLife International and it&rsquo;s a whopper Unlike betaine anhydrous, where you&rsquo;re getting a full 1.5g of betaine, with 1g of betaine nitrate, it works out to be about 65.4% betaine (654mg) and 34.6% nitrate (346mg). Therefore, by combining both forms, you get just over 2g of betaine. But the betaine is not the main star of the show with this ingredient, it&rsquo;s the nitrates! We previously mentioned that betaine has the ability to boost nitric oxide levels in the body, which helps increase performance by enhancing oxygen delivery to the working muscle and shuttling more lactic acid away.[7] The added nitrates can further increase nitric oxide levels, through being readily absorbed by the gut and converted into a nitrite anion, which can be...",

Who&rsquo;s ready for some Whiskey Sour Ghost Legend?! Ghost Burn BLACK: Two New Ingredients, Two New Flavors. Last year, Ghost re-launched their fat burner as a powder instead of a capsule and switched the name from Infrared to Ghost Burn. Changing their fat burner into a powder was a great choice, because it allows for a larger serving size, more ingredients, and customization, so you can decide how much &lsquo;burn&rsquo; you want to feel. There are still a lot of capsule products on the market, but powders are becoming the norm.

Burn Black is only going to be available on Ghost&rsquo;s website, and for a limited time, so once it releases you better be quick! It&rsquo;s launching in two flavors that aren&rsquo;t available in the regular Burn, Pineapple and Welch&rsquo;s Grape Juice. Just by watching the video and seeing the label, we think this is going to do very well and may return once it&rsquo;s sold out, but there&rsquo;s never any guaranteeing that.

L-Carnitine Tartrate &ndash; 1.5g. Acetyl-L-Carnitine &ndash; 1.5g. Choline Bitartrate &ndash; 1g. KSM-66\u24c7 Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) Root Extract &ndash; 600mg. L-Tyrosine &ndash; 500mg. Cocoa Bean (Theobroma cacao) Seed extract (20% Theobromine) &ndash; 100mg (Yielding 20mg) NeuroFactor&trade; Coffee (Coffea arabica) Fruit extract &ndash; 100mg. Grains of Paradise (Aframomum melegueta) Seed extract (std. To 12% 6-paradol) &ndash; 40mg. If you want a full break down of each of these ingredients, check out our original Ghost Burn Product Breakdown. Now let&rsquo;s move on to what&rsquo;s so special about Ghost Burn Black! New Additions! Garcinia Cambogia (60% Hydroxycitric Acid) &ndash; 1.5g. Limited edition, once it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone. The first addition to the special edition of Ghost Burn Black, is Garcinia Cambogia, also called Malabar tamarind. It&rsquo;s a tropical fruit that is commonly found in India and Southeast Asia. Over the years it&rsquo;s been widely used in several weight loss products since it contains a high amount of hydroxycitric acid (HCA). Despite any outlandish claims you may have heard, HCA from Garcinia works very well for appetite suppression, increasing fat oxidation, and greater fat loss.[1-3] The original formula didn&rsquo;t have anything to specifically tackle appetite, but some people still noticed reduced hunger from the other ingredients. Garcinia is sure to help you with any hunger pangs you may notice while trying to lose fat! This is a great dose to get all the benefits from this ingredient! Natural Caffeine &ndash; 300mg. Can this tropical flavor cover up the spice?! The original Ghost Burn contains 300mg of caffeine anhydrous to get you energized, however the new Ghost Burn Black utilizes the same dose but of natural caffeine. Why the change? Two main reasons Ghost decided to switch the caffeine source was to create a more global compliant formula and the natural caffeine provides more of a smooth, sustained increase in energy. Caffeine anhydrous is the synthetic form of caffeine found in several supplements, and although it works extremely well, for some people it hits them a little too hard, giving them anxiety and the jitters. Natural caffeine works just as well, but may help keep you energized for longer without the side effects commonly seen with a high dose of caffeine. Overall, we are happy with the switch and think it will be better for more people, especially those with a lower caffeine tolerance. Gamma-Butyrobetaine Ethyl Ester (GBB) &ndash; 50mg. Get ready to start sweating! GBB is naturally a part of our carnitine production process... when we take it... we get more carnitine and its effects! Gamma-Butyrobetaine Ethyl Ester (GBB), also called &gamma;-butyrobetaine in research, is an ingredient that you can really feel, because it increases sweating and thermogenesis quickly! Dan from Ghost is a big fan of this ingredient and loves to take it right before a big training session. It helps you get warmed up and in the zone much faster. Increased sweating is not all GBB can do to help with fat loss, the main benefits come from increasing carnitine levels in the body.[4] GBB works by acting as an intermediate that the body can convert to L-carnitine via an enzyme called Gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBD).[5] Increased carnitine levels are very beneficial, because it acts a shuttle for fatty acids to enter the mitochondria and be used for energy.[6] Therefore, greater fat oxidation can yield more energy and fat loss. The original Ghost Burn doesn&rsquo;t contain this ingredient, so it will be interesting to see what people think about the new addition. Astragin\u24c7 &ndash; 50mg. AstraGin is a combination of Astragalus and Panax Notoginseng that&rsquo;s been shown to increase ingredient absorption, especially of amino acids! The original Ghost Burn uses Bioperine (black pepper extract) to help in absorption and bioavailability of the ingredients, with this new formula Ghost decided to use Astragin\u24c7 instead which is a blend of two plant extracts, Astragalus membranaceus and Panax notoginseng. This is a patented ingredient from NuLiv Science that&rsquo;s designed to help increase absorption of several ingredients such as amino acids, creatine, vitamins and minerals, and other key nutrients.[7] Astragin\u24c7 is highly effective and Ghost includes it in various other products, because it simply works! Ghost Partners with NuLiv Science! What&rsquo;s even more exciting is that Ghost just recently announced they exclusively partnered with NuLiv Science to do more research assessing the effects of AstraGin combined with Choline and Carnitine to see if how much it can increase their absorption. It&rsquo;s really great to see such a massive company like Ghost get invest in research to move the industry forward. Ghost has understood the power of AstraGin for a long time and you&rsquo;ll see it in several of their products, but having more studies that specifically look at certain ingredient will help everyone formulate better supplements. We can&rsquo;t stress the importance of bioavailability enough, becuase regardless of what product you take, it&rsquo;s not effective if you body lacks the ability to utilize it. Absorption truly makes or breaks an ingredient. More details will be coming soon and PricePlow will make sure you stay up to date on the newest research! Available Flavors: Ghost never disappoints on flavors, so no matter what you chose, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed! Below you&rsquo;ll find an updated list of Ghost Burn Black&rsquo;s Flavors: As you&rsquo;ll notice, there are two new flavors never used in the original Burn formula:Welch&rsquo;s Grape Juice and Pineapple! We&rsquo;re unsure if these will show up in the original Burn formula, but we are huge fans of Ghost Amino in Welch&rsquo;s flavor and can&rsquo;t wait to see what it&rsquo;s like with some extra spice! Final Remarks: Ghost Burn Black, Get it Before it&rsquo;s Gone! There&rsquo;s nothing Ghost loves more than fitness, Nike Air Max sneakers, and crushing some cereal while playing Tony Hawk in the office. So if you look at the new Ghost Burn Black label and it reminds you of your favorite shoes...",

            "articleBody": "Kaged Muscle Hydra-Charge Pink Lemonade is out, and it&rsquo;s fantastic! But keep reading to learn the true origin of pink lemonade! Whether you use it as a standalone hydration supplement, or a low-artificial-sweetener flavoring system for your unflavored supplements, the feedback is always the same: Hydra-Charge rules! But now it rules even more, because Kris Gethin and the team behind Kaged Muscle have released their incredibly popular hydration supplement in the new Pink Lemonade flavor! As discussed in our original Hydra-Charge blog post (which will have the most details on the ingredients), this wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to be a standalone supplement! It was originally meant to be used as the flavoring system for Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s unflavored series of stackable supplements. As Adam Kossoff of Kaged Muscle told us late in 2019, &ldquo;HYDRA-CHARGE started as the flavoring system for the mix-your-own stack (and it still makes a great flavor agent for any &ldquo;unflavored&rdquo; supplement on the market) &ndash; but it&rsquo;s become an essential part of a lot of our customer&rsquo;s stacks.&rdquo; &mdash; Adam Kossoff, Kaged Muscle Below we briefly discuss this flavor system, show our tasting review, and discuss its benefits, both.

The story behind &ldquo;pink lemonade&rdquo; is actually quite absurd. Pink lemons do exist, but this &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t come from them (and those lemons have clear juice like regular lemons anyway). So where is it from? According to the Smithsonian Magazine,[1] there are two theories in play, both from the wild world of circuses in the 1800s. The following research was dug up by Josh Chetwynd, who wrote How the Hot Dog Got its Bun: Accidental Discoveries And Unexpected Inspirations That Shape What We Eat And Drink[2] and Harvey W. Root, who wrote The Ways Of The Circus: Being The Memories And Adventures Of George Conklin, Tamer Of Lions (1921):[3] Theory 1: Cinnamon candies were accidentally dropped into the lemonade. Some believe that a man named Henry E. Allott invented pink lemonade when he accidentally dropped red-colored cinnamon candies into the lemonade.[2] As they say, &ldquo;The show must go on&rdquo;, so he sold them and they were a popular hit. What&rsquo;s the origin of pink lemonade? Who knows, but this flavor is terrific! That&rsquo;s reasonable, but we tend to like Theory 2 even better: Theory 2: Water from washing the pink tights. A bit more appalling, many believe that the true inventor of Pink Lemonade was Pete Conklin in 1857, who was running the lemonade stand but ran out of water. With some quick thinking on his feet, he grabbed the quickest water he could find: dirty water from a tub that had just been used to clean a performer&rsquo;s pink tights![3] Because of this, the water was dyed pink, so he called it &ldquo;strawberry lemonade&rdquo;, and given the novelty of the drink (remember &ndash; as we know in the supplement game, &ldquo;color tastes better&rdquo;), sales doubled and the rest was history. It&rsquo;s unclear which story is really true, but pink lemonade has taken on a life of its own, and we can guarantee you that Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s Pink Lemonade flavor system does not come from Kris Gethin&rsquo;s dirty pink tights!! With that said, let&rsquo;s get down to business: Hydra-Charge. &ldquo;Hydrate and defend&rdquo; with Hydra-Charge. The incredible Kris Gethin showing how you flavor the solo ingredients from KM: with Hydra-Charge! Again, you can read the details on our main Kaged Muscle Hydra-Charge blog post, but the long story short is that this supplement is built with electrolytes and micronutrients. When used alone, it&rsquo;s typically a way to get some electrolytes, hydration, and to satisfy the sweet tooth. In addition, it provides some defense against free radicals with SPECTRA, an antioxidant blend of high-ORAC fruits, vegetables, and other herbal extracts. The Hydra-Charge stacking system. As mentioned above, Hydra-Charge was originally meant to be stacked with KM&rsquo;s unflavored powders! Some examples are Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s Citrulline (for nitric oxide pumps), Fermented BCAAs and/or KM&rsquo;s Glutamine for anti-catabolic effects when training, or CreaClear creatine for some extra strength, power, and size. But truth be told &ndash; most consumers (ourselves included) just love to sip on it solo! The Kaged Muscle Hydra-Charge Ingredients. Below is a brief explanation of what you&rsquo;ll find in Hydra-Charge: The Electrolytes. Keep the electrolytes coming, and the taurine brings &lsquo;instant&rsquo; endurance in Hydra-Charge Hydra-Charge has five electrolytes &ndash; magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and calcium &mdash; which are all essential for optimal hydration demands, especially for athletes. These minerals conduct electric signals (hence the name &ldquo;electro&rdquo;-lytes) and in turn help regulate nerve and muscle function, bone mineral density, blood pressure, fluid balance, and even assist with muscle tissue damage repair. As we stripmine our agriculture more and more over time and avoid using proper farming methods (which involves manure to replace the above elements and more), our vegetables are becoming more and more devoid of these minerals over time. Taurine and coconut water powder. In addition, there&rsquo;s 500mg of coconut water powder and a clinical 1g taurine to complete the hydration matrix. Coconut water powder helps add some flavor and more electrolytes, which taurine has several benefits for hydration and increases endurance and athletic performance, as well as several other benefits.[4] SPECTRA antioxidant blend. Next, we have SPECTRA, a trademarked blend of antioxidants from fruits, vegetables, and herbal extracts / concentrates. Kaged Muscle calls it the &ldquo;next generation of free-radical defense&rdquo; because it has high-ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) components that may protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. Again, you can read far more details with more sources cited in our primary Kaged Muscle Hydra-Charge article. Hydration system or flavor system? Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s Tawna Eubanks-McCoy knows the truth: it&rsquo;s both! Have you tried it yet? Kaged Muscle flavoring system. As the driving force of Kaged Muscle, Kris Gethin follows a mostly-holistic lifestyle, and like all other KM supplements, Hydra-charge has no artificial colors or flavors. It&rsquo;s colored with one of the best beet root extracts on the market. There&rsquo;s mostly stevia sweetening, but a bit of sucralose (less than other supplements) to beat the stevia aftertaste down. The system works and it works well. To learn more about this, read our article titled Above and Beyond: How the Kaged Muscle Flavoring System Works, which discusses how Brian Rand, chief formulator for Kaged Muscle, made it happen. All Hydra-Charge Flavors Available: Look at those flavor crystals! Hydra-Charge&rsquo;s Fruit Punch is insanely good!! This pink lemonade flavor system is fantastic. It is refreshing, delicious, and enjoyable. The only question is, &ldquo;Can it beat the fruit punch flavor?&rdquo; Because quite honestly, Hydra-Charge&rsquo;s fruit punch flavor system is top-tier &mdash; quite possibly the best fruit punch on the market. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Pink Lemonade flavors, you will love Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s take on it. But if you love KM&rsquo;s fruit punch as much as we do, you know that it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to beat that flavor &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not saying anything bad about this new flavor here! Kaged Muscle&rsquo;s second Pink Lemonade supplement. Not everyone is Branch Warren sized and can chug 20oz like it&rsquo;s nothing. Tawna Eubanks is stoked for a full dosing of Pre-Kaged in just 12oz! Fans of Kris Gethin and Team KM will note that this isn&rsquo;t their first time using a pink lemonade flavor system &ndash; in October of 2019, they launched the Pink Lemonade flavor of Pre-Kaged. On top of being a fantastic flavor, the big news is that it required far less water than other flavors of Pre-Kaged, which many customers had asked for. With a successful launch there, it was time to take this fantastic flavor to Hydra-Charge. Conclusion: Hydra-Charge rules that much more. Now that you know the &lsquo;disputable&rsquo; origins of Pink Lemonade, and what makes Hydra-Charge so special, the only question left is which flavor to get. This supplement is a life-saver (see the additional videos below), and we call on it for help any time there&rsquo;s cramps, stomach sickness, or anything requiring additional hydration. Every supplement cabinet should have at least one tub of Hydra-Charge, and now you can add the infamous pink lemonade flavor to your menu of options!
